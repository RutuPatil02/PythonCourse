Reading Files
Information stored in files can be accessed by a Python program. To get access to the contents of a file, 
you need to open the file in your program. When you are done using a file, you should close it.

Opening and Closing A File
Python has a built-in function open that can open a file for reading.

The form of open is open(filename, mode), where mode is 'r' (to open for reading), 'w' (to open for writing),
 or 'a' (to open for appending to what is already in the file).

This opens a file called In Flanders Fields.txt for reading:

flanders_file = open('In Flanders Fields.txt', 'r')
Note that if the file is saved in the same directory as your program, you can simply write the name of the file, 
as what was done in the above example. However, if it is not saved in the same directory, you must provide the path to it.

To close a file, you write flanders_file.close() .

There are four standard ways to read from a file. Some use these methods:

**readline(): read and return the next line from the file, including the newline character (if it exists). 
Return the empty string if there are no more lines in the file.

**readlines(): read and return all lines in a file in a list. The lines include the newline character.

**read(): read the whole file as a single string.


Approach	                    Code	                            When to use it
The readline approach	        file = open(filename, 'r')          When you want to process only part of a file.
                                # Read lines until we reach the
                                # place in the file that we want.
                                line = file.readline()
                                while we are not at the place we want:
                                    line = file.readline()

                                # Now we have reached the section
                                # of the file we want to process.

                                line = file.readline()
                                while we are not at the end of the section:
                                    process the line
                                    line = file.readline()

                                flanders_file.close()

The for line in file approach	file = open(filename, 'r')           When you want to process every line in the file one at a time.
                                for line in file:
                                    process the line

                                file.close()


The read approach	        file = open(filename, 'r')                When you want to read the whole file at once and use it 
                            contents = file.read()                      as a single string.
                            now process contents
                            file.close()

The readlines approach	    file = open(filename, 'r')                 When you want to examine each line of a file by index.

                            # Get the contents as a list of strings.
                            contents_list = file.readlines()

                            process contents_list using indexing to
                            access particular lines from the file

                            file.close()




Examples from the video
Here are the code examples that appeared in the video. All of them read the entire file into a string and print that string.

*** The readline approach
flanders_file = open(flanders_filename, 'r')
flanders_poem = ''

line = flanders_file.readline()
while line != "":
    flanders_poem = flanders_poem + line
    line = flanders_file.readline()

print(flanders_poem)
flanders_file.close()
        
**The for line in file approach
flanders_file = open(flanders_filename, 'r')
flanders_poem = ''

for line in flanders_file:
    flanders_poem = flanders_poem + line

print(flanders_poem)
flanders_file.close()
        
**The read approach
flanders_file = open(flanders_filename, 'r')
flanders_poem = flanders_file.read()

print(flanders_poem)
flanders_file.close()

**The readlines approach
flanders_file = open(flanders_filename, 'r')
flanders_poem = ''

flanders_list = flanders_file.readlines()
for line in flanders_list:
    flanders_poem = flanders_poem + line

print(flanders_poem)
flanders_file.close()
